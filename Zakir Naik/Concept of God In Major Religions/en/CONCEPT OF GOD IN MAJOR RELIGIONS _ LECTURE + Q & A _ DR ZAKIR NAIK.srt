00:00:59,921 --> 00:01:03,440

00:01:24,005 --> 00:03:28,904
[Arabic Recitation from Quran:2:255]

9
00:03:31,038 --> 00:03:38,397
The translation from Surah
Al-Baqarah, Chapter 2 - verse 255.

10
00:03:38,873 --> 00:03:43,119
‘I seek refuge with Allah
from saitan the accursed.

11
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:47,649
In the Name of Allah, Most
Gracious, Most Merciful.

12
00:03:48,726 --> 00:03:51,920
Allah, there is no God but He,

13
00:03:52,206 --> 00:03:55,968
the Living, the Self Subsisting, Eternal -

14
00:03:56,366 --> 00:03:59,509
 - No slumber can seize Him nor sleep.

15
00:03:59,747 --> 00:04:03,255
His are all the things in
the heavens and on earth.

16
00:04:03,548 --> 00:04:08,722
Who is there can intercede in His
presence except as He permits.

17
00:04:09,155 --> 00:04:13,345
He knows what appears to His creatures,

18
00:04:14,036 --> 00:04:17,655
as before or after, or behind Him.

19
00:04:17,897 --> 00:04:22,722
Nor shall they compass aught of His
knowledge, except as He wills.

20
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:27,594
His throne does extend over
the heavens and the earth,

21
00:04:27,691 --> 00:04:32,517
and He feels no fatigue in the
guarding and preserving them,

22
00:04:32,568 --> 00:04:36,679
for He is the most High,
the Supreme in glory’.

23
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:41,615
In the Name of Allah, Most
Gracious, Most Merciful.

24
00:04:43,176 --> 00:04:45,620
‘Say: O people of the Book

25
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:49,235
come to common terms
as between us and you.

26
00:04:49,502 --> 00:04:51,835
 That we worship none but Allah,

27
00:04:51,994 --> 00:04:54,724
that we associate no partners with Him.

28
00:04:54,841 --> 00:04:57,572
That we erect not from amongst ourselves,

29
00:04:57,619 --> 00:05:00,269
Lords and patrons other than Allah.

30
00:05:00,556 --> 00:05:03,286
If then they turn back,

31
00:05:03,311 --> 00:05:07,442
say: Bear witness that
we at least are Muslims

32
00:05:07,537 --> 00:05:09,902
bowing to the will of Allah.

33
00:05:10,104 --> 00:05:12,866
Verily Allah has spoken the truth’.

34
00:05:14,162 --> 00:05:17,162
<font color="#ff8000">(Dr. Muhammed):</font> Respected
brothers and sisters,

35
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:19,258

36

May peace be on you

37
00:05:21,683 --> 00:05:24,921
On behalf of the Islamic
Research Foundation,

38
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,810
I Dr. Muhammad Naik,

39
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:29,926
welcome all of you to today’s programme.

40
00:05:30,134 --> 00:05:33,911
As did I, you may too
have read, two days back,

41
00:05:34,039 --> 00:05:36,785
in the sacred space of ‘The
Times of India’, Mumbai,

42
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:38,542
the following verses…

43
00:05:38,964 --> 00:05:40,488
And I quote,

44
00:05:41,066 --> 00:05:43,224
‘Hold fast all together,

45
00:05:43,249 --> 00:05:44,431
to God’s rope

46
00:05:44,669 --> 00:05:47,558
and be not divided among yourselves.

47
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:49,784
Remember with gratitude,

48
00:05:49,881 --> 00:05:51,167
God’s favour on you,

49
00:05:51,197 --> 00:05:52,411
for you were enemies,

50
00:05:52,436 --> 00:05:54,463
and He joined your hearts in love -

51
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:57,774
So that by His grace you became brethren.

52
00:05:58,819 --> 00:06:02,084
Let there arise out of you, one community,

53
00:06:02,209 --> 00:06:04,828
 inviting to all that is good,

54
00:06:04,923 --> 00:06:06,558
 enjoining what is right,

55
00:06:06,622 --> 00:06:08,511
and forbidding what is wrong’ -

56
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:14,790
Holy Qur’an, Surah Al Imran, Chapter.
3, verses 103 and 104.

57
00:06:15,841 --> 00:06:19,158
 This quotation aptly represents,

58
00:06:19,238 --> 00:06:23,444
the Islamic Research Foundation’s
striving for Islamic Dawa’h,

59
00:06:23,524 --> 00:06:27,365
the proper presentation,
understanding and clarification

60
00:06:27,413 --> 00:06:31,000
of the message of Islam, amongst
Muslims and Non-Muslims,

61
00:06:31,105 --> 00:06:34,025
as well as removing
misconceptions about Islam,

62
00:06:34,242 --> 00:06:36,687
amongst Muslims and Non-Muslims.

63
00:06:37,576 --> 00:06:40,591
Reason, logic, and modern
scientific understanding,

64
00:06:40,681 --> 00:06:43,470
are the basis of all our presentations.

65
00:06:44,452 --> 00:06:46,626
Dr. Zakir Naik,

66
00:06:46,737 --> 00:06:49,420
A medical doctor by professional training

67
00:06:49,658 --> 00:06:51,388
has devoted himself

68
00:06:51,642 --> 00:06:55,039
for analyzing Islam and
other religion objectively.

69
00:06:55,385 --> 00:06:57,686
To understand and spread the real truth

70
00:06:57,754 --> 00:07:01,992
understanding and clarifications
about religion at the way of life.
