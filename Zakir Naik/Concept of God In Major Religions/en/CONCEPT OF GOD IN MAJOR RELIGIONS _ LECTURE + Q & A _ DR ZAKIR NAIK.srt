‘I seek refuge with Allah
from saitan the accursed.

11
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:47,649
In the Name of Allah, Most
Gracious, Most Merciful.

12
00:03:48,726 --> 00:03:51,920
Allah, there is no God but He,

13
00:03:52,206 --> 00:03:55,968
the Living, the Self Subsisting, Eternal -

14
00:03:56,366 --> 00:03:59,509
 - No slumber can seize Him nor sleep.

15
00:03:59,747 --> 00:04:03,255
His are all the things in
the heavens and on earth.

16
00:04:03,548 --> 00:04:08,722
Who is there can intercede in His
presence except as He permits.

17
00:04:09,155 --> 00:04:13,345
He knows what appears to His creatures,

18
00:04:14,036 --> 00:04:17,655
as before or after, or behind Him.

19
00:04:17,897 --> 00:04:22,722
Nor shall they compass aught of His
knowledge, except as He wills.

20
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:27,594
His throne does extend over
the heavens and the earth,

21
00:04:27,691 --> 00:04:32,517
and He feels no fatigue in the
guarding and preserving them,

22
00:04:32,568 --> 00:04:36,679
for He is the most High,
the Supreme in glory’.

23
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:41,615
In the Name of Allah, Most
Gracious, Most Merciful.

24
00:04:43,176 --> 00:04:45,620
‘Say: O people of the Book

25
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:49,235
come to common terms
as between us and you.

26
00:04:49,502 --> 00:04:51,835
 That we worship none but Allah,

27
00:04:51,994 --> 00:04:54,724
that we associate no partners with Him.

28
00:04:54,841 --> 00:04:57,572
That we erect not from amongst ourselves,

29
00:04:57,619 --> 00:05:00,269
Lords and patrons other than Allah.

30
00:05:00,556 --> 00:05:03,286
If then they turn back,

31
00:05:03,311 --> 00:05:07,442
say: Bear witness that
we at least are Muslims

32
00:05:07,537 --> 00:05:09,902
bowing to the will of Allah.

33
00:05:10,104 --> 00:05:12,866

welcome all of you to today’s programme.

40
00:05:30,134 --> 00:05:33,911
As did I, you may too
have read, two days back,

41
00:05:34,039 --> 00:05:36,785
in the sacred space of ‘The
Times of India’, Mumbai,

42
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:38,542
the following verses…

43
00:05:38,964 --> 00:05:40,488
And I quote,

44
00:05:41,066 --> 00:05:43,224
‘Hold fast all together,

45
00:05:43,249 --> 00:05:44,431

and be not divided among yourselves.

47
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:49,784
Remember with gratitude,

48
00:05:49,881 --> 00:05:51,167
God’s favour on you,

49
00:05:51,197 --> 00:05:52,411
for you were enemies,

50
00:05:52,436 --> 00:05:54,463
and He joined your hearts in love -

51
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:57,774
So that by His grace you became brethren.

52
00:05:58,819 --> 00:06:02,084
Let there arise out of you, one community,

53
00:06:02,209 --> 00:06:04,828
 inviting to all that is good,

54
00:06:04,923 --> 00:06:06,558

57
00:06:15,841 --> 00:06:19,158
 This quotation aptly represents,

58
00:06:19,238 --> 00:06:23,444
the Islamic Research Foundation’s
striving for Islamic Dawa’h,

59
00:06:23,524 --> 00:06:27,365
the proper presentation,
understanding and clarification

60
00:06:27,413 --> 00:06:31,000
of the message of Islam, amongst
Muslims and Non-Muslims,

61
00:06:31,105 --> 00:06:34,025
as well as removing
misconceptions about Islam,

62
00:06:34,242 --> 00:06:36,687
amongst Muslims and Non-Muslims.

63
00:06:37,576 --> 00:06:40,591
Reason, logic, and modern
scientific understanding,

64
00:06:40,681 --> 00:06:43,470
are the basis of all our presentations.

65
00:06:44,452 --> 00:06:46,626
Dr. Zakir Naik,

66
00:06:46,737 --> 00:06:49,420
A medical doctor by professional training

67
00:06:49,658 --> 00:06:51,388
has devoted himself

68
00:06:51,642 --> 00:06:55,039
for analyzing Islam and
other religion objectively.

69
00:06:55,385 --> 00:06:57,686
To understand and spread the real truth

70
00:06:57,754 --> 00:07:01,992
understanding and clarifications
about religion at the way of life.

71
00:07:03,184 --> 00:07:06,962
He is an international orator on
Islam and comparative religion.

72
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:10,809
In fact, in the last one year itself,

73
00:07:11,755 --> 00:07:14,136
In addition to his many talks in India,

74
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:18,730

81
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:36,050
 scientific approach toward his subject.

82
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:39,745
He is appreciated for his
comparative knowledge of

83
00:07:39,821 --> 00:07:43,049
Hinduism, Judaism, Christianity and Islam.

84
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:45,601
Specially for his verbatim quotations.

85
00:07:45,692 --> 00:07:47,557
from religious scriptures.

86
00:07:47,902 --> 00:07:50,653
Concept of God in major religions.

87
00:07:51,313 --> 00:07:53,786
why have we chosen this topic?

88
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:58,898
We not only need to understand  and realize

89
00:07:59,046 --> 00:08:00,541
what God is,

90
00:08:00,713 --> 00:08:02,221
And what are His Qualities,

91
00:08:02,339 --> 00:08:05,196
but also, and it is very important,

92
00:08:05,329 --> 00:08:08,914
we need to know what God certainly is not.

93
00:08:11,563 --> 00:08:12,768
Brothers and sisters,

94
00:08:12,793 --> 00:08:15,567
to promote better
understanding and integration

95
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,622
on simiarities between religions.

96
00:08:17,851 --> 00:08:19,923
As well as living in real hermony

97
00:08:19,985 --> 00:08:21,449

106
00:08:49,189 --> 00:08:50,778
and my dear Brothers and Sisters,

107
00:08:51,237 --> 00:08:52,696
I welcome all of you

108
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,231
with the Islamic greetings,

109
00:08:54,293 --> 00:08:56,066

of Almighty God be on all of you.

113
00:09:04,783 --> 00:09:07,085
The Non-Muslims may be wondering

114
00:09:07,381 --> 00:09:10,264
that, what was I murmuring, or uttering

115
00:09:10,485 --> 00:09:12,081
in the beginning of my talk.

116
00:09:12,737 --> 00:09:15,321
I was not trying to mesmerize you,

117
00:09:15,347 --> 00:09:16,503
or hypnotize you,

118
00:09:16,961 --> 00:09:18,760
but I was reciting

119
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:20,990
few verses of the Holy Qur’an

120
00:09:21,038 --> 00:09:24,753
from Surah Taha, Ch. No. 20,

121
00:09:24,832 --> 00:09:26,880
verses No. 25 and 28.

122
00:09:27,299 --> 00:09:29,299
When Allah Subhana Wa Taala,

123
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:33,712
Almighty God asks Prophet
Moses (peace be upon him)

124
00:09:33,769 --> 00:09:36,727
to deliver the message to the Pharoah,

125
00:09:37,388 --> 00:09:39,261
Moses (peace be upon him),

126
00:09:39,325 --> 00:09:40,357
he prays

127
00:09:40,404 --> 00:09:42,563
to Almighty God, Allah Subhana Wa Taala,

128
00:09:42,674 --> 00:09:44,182
 and recites these verses.

129
00:09:44,496 --> 00:09:46,359
 (Arabic)

130
00:09:46,742 --> 00:09:47,923
‘Oh my Lord

131
00:09:47,972 --> 00:09:49,738
expand my breast for me,

132
00:09:49,818 --> 00:09:51,812
 Expand my center for me,

133
00:09:52,307 --> 00:09:53,974
 (Arabic)…

134
00:09:54,051 --> 00:09:56,492
And make my task easy for me,

135
00:09:56,541 --> 00:09:58,674
(Arabic)…

136
00:09:58,838 --> 00:10:02,151
And remove the impediment from my speech’.

137
00:10:03,047 --> 00:10:04,326
Since we know

138
00:10:04,419 --> 00:10:06,414
 that Prophet Moses (peace be upon him)

139
00:10:06,459 --> 00:10:08,387
was a stamerer, was a stuterer.

140
00:10:08,452 --> 00:10:10,774
 So he prays to the Almighty God

141
00:10:10,902 --> 00:10:12,931
to remove the stamering,

142
00:10:13,007 --> 00:10:14,360
to loosen his tongue,

143
00:10:14,549 --> 00:10:15,751
as well as

144
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:17,997
 remove the barrier,

145
00:10:18,213 --> 00:10:20,526
if there is any between him,

146
00:10:20,571 --> 00:10:22,204
and the person to whom

147
00:10:22,249 --> 00:10:23,701
he is going to deliver the message.

148
00:10:24,281 --> 00:10:25,709
If a person

149
00:10:25,913 --> 00:10:27,092
 is giving a talk,

150
00:10:27,217 --> 00:10:28,544
 on other religions,

151
00:10:28,964 --> 00:10:31,084
those people in the audience

152
00:10:31,164 --> 00:10:33,579
who do not belong to that religion,

153
00:10:33,682 --> 00:10:35,167
they may think

154
00:10:35,245 --> 00:10:37,570
that this person is going to speak

155
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:39,079
 against their Religion.

156
00:10:39,514 --> 00:10:40,841
For example,

157
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:42,610
if suppose,

158
00:10:42,746 --> 00:10:43,665
a Hindu

159
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:45,978
is giving a talk on other Religions,

160
00:10:46,384 --> 00:10:49,026
the Non-Hindus may feel that,

161
00:10:49,059 --> 00:10:52,057
he is going to speak against my Religion.

162
00:10:52,812 --> 00:10:54,168
If a Christian

163
00:10:54,197 --> 00:10:56,505
is giving a talk on other Religions,

164
00:10:56,857 --> 00:10:58,921
gions, the Non-Hindus may feel

165
00:10:59,043 --> 00:11:00,385
that, he is going to speak

166
00:11:00,465 --> 00:11:01,749
 against my Religion.

167
00:11:02,469 --> 00:11:03,638
Similarly,

168
00:11:03,775 --> 00:11:05,023
I being a Muslim,

169
00:11:05,237 --> 00:11:08,303
when I am giving a talk on other Religions,

170
00:11:08,742 --> 00:11:11,311
the Non-Muslims may feel that,

171
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:13,930
I am going to speak against their Religion.

172
00:11:14,188 --> 00:11:15,465
That is the reason,

173
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:18,090
I am praying to Allah Subhana Wa Taala,

174
00:11:18,154 --> 00:11:19,503
Almighty God,

175
00:11:19,862 --> 00:11:21,262
to loosen my tongue

176
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:24,155
as well as remove the impediment,

177
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:25,035
he barrier

178
00:11:25,143 --> 00:11:26,536
mental or otherwise,

179
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,981
if there is any, between me and you.

180
00:11:31,027 --> 00:11:32,145
The topic

181
00:11:32,221 --> 00:11:33,941
of this morning’s talk is…

182
00:11:34,073 --> 00:11:37,512
‘Concept of God in Major Religions’.
