00:03:31,038 --> 00:03:38,397
The translation from Surah
Al-Baqarah, Chapter 2 - verse 255.

10
00:03:38,873 --> 00:03:43,119
‘I seek refuge with Allah
from saitan the accursed.

11
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:47,649
In the Name of Allah, Most
Gracious, Most Merciful.

12
00:03:48,726 --> 00:03:51,920
Allah, there is no God but He,

13
00:03:52,206 --> 00:03:55,968
the Living, the Self Subsisting, Eternal -

14
00:03:56,366 --> 00:03:59,509
 - No slumber can seize Him nor sleep.

15
00:03:59,747 --> 00:04:03,255
His are all the things in
the heavens and on earth.

16
00:04:03,548 --> 00:04:08,722
Who is there can intercede in His
presence except as He permits.

17
00:04:09,155 --> 00:04:13,345
He knows what appears to His creatures,

18
00:04:14,036 --> 00:04:17,655
as before or after, or behind Him.

19
00:04:17,897 --> 00:04:22,722
Nor shall they compass aught of His
knowledge, except as He wills.

20
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:27,594
His throne does extend over
the heavens and the earth,

21
00:04:27,691 --> 00:04:32,517
and He feels no fatigue in the
guarding and preserving them,

22
00:04:32,568 --> 00:04:36,679
for He is the most High,
the Supreme in glory’.

23
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:41,615
In the Name of Allah, Most
Gracious, Most Merciful.

24
00:04:43,176 --> 00:04:45,620
‘Say: O people of the Book

25
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:49,235
come to common terms
as between us and you.

26
00:04:49,502 --> 00:04:51,835
 That we worship none but Allah,

27
00:04:51,994 --> 00:04:54,724
that we associate no partners with Him.

28
00:04:54,841 --> 00:04:57,572
That we erect not from amongst ourselves,

29
00:04:57,619 --> 00:05:00,269
Lords and patrons other than Allah.

30
00:05:00,556 --> 00:05:03,286
If then they turn back,

31
00:05:03,311 --> 00:05:07,442
say: Bear witness that
we at least are Muslims

32
00:05:07,537 --> 00:05:09,902
bowing to the will of Allah.

33
00:05:10,104 --> 00:05:12,866

welcome all of you to today’s programme.

40
00:05:30,134 --> 00:05:33,911
As did I, you may too
have read, two days back,

41
00:05:34,039 --> 00:05:36,785
in the sacred space of ‘The
Times of India’, Mumbai,

42
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:38,542
the following verses…

43
00:05:38,964 --> 00:05:40,488
And I quote,

44
00:05:41,066 --> 00:05:43,224
‘Hold fast all together,

45
00:05:43,249 --> 00:05:44,431

46

and be not divided among yourselves.

47
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:49,784
Remember with gratitude,

48
00:05:49,881 --> 00:05:51,167
God’s favour on you,

49
00:05:51,197 --> 00:05:52,411
for you were enemies,

50
00:05:52,436 --> 00:05:54,463
and He joined your hearts in love -

51
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:57,774
So that by His grace you became brethren.

52
00:05:58,819 --> 00:06:02,084
Let there arise out of you, one community,

53
00:06:02,209 --> 00:06:04,828
 inviting to all that is good,

54
00:06:04,923 --> 00:06:06,558

55
00:06:06,622 --> 00:06:08,511

56
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:14,790

3, verses 103 and 104.

57
00:06:15,841 --> 00:06:19,158
 This quotation aptly represents,

58
00:06:19,238 --> 00:06:23,444
the Islamic Research Foundation’s
striving for Islamic Dawa’h,

59
00:06:23,524 --> 00:06:27,365
the proper presentation,
understanding and clarification

60
00:06:27,413 --> 00:06:31,000
of the message of Islam, amongst
Muslims and Non-Muslims,

61
00:06:31,105 --> 00:06:34,025
as well as removing
misconceptions about Islam,

62
00:06:34,242 --> 00:06:36,687
amongst Muslims and Non-Muslims.

63
00:06:37,576 --> 00:06:40,591
Reason, logic, and modern
scientific understanding,

64
00:06:40,616 --> 00:06:43,405
are the basis of all our presentations.

65
00:06:44,452 --> 00:06:46,626
Dr. Zakir Naik,

66
00:06:46,657 --> 00:06:49,340
A medical doctor by professional training

67
00:06:49,658 --> 00:06:51,388
has devoted himself

68
00:06:51,642 --> 00:06:55,039
for analyzing Islam and
other religion objectively.

69
00:06:55,385 --> 00:06:57,686
To understand and spread the real truth

70
00:06:57,754 --> 00:07:01,992
understanding and clarifications
about religion at the way of life.

71
00:07:03,184 --> 00:07:06,962
He is an international orator on
Islam and comparative religion.

72
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:10,809
In fact, in the last one year itself,

73
00:07:11,755 --> 00:07:14,136
In addition to his many talks in India,

74
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:18,730

for his logical, reasonable and

81
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:36,050
 scientific approach toward his subject.

82
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:39,745
He is appreciated for his
comparative knowledge of

83
00:07:39,821 --> 00:07:43,049
Hinduism, Judaism, Christianity and Islam.

84
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:45,601
Specially for his verbatim quotations.

85
00:07:45,692 --> 00:07:47,557
from religious scriptures.

86
00:07:47,902 --> 00:07:50,653
Concept of God in major religions.

87
00:07:51,313 --> 00:07:53,786
why have we chosen this topic?

88
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:58,898
We not only need to understand  and realize

89
00:07:59,046 --> 00:08:00,541
what God is,

90
00:08:00,713 --> 00:08:02,221
And what are His Qualities,

91
00:08:02,339 --> 00:08:05,196
but also, and it is very important,

92
00:08:05,329 --> 00:08:08,914
we need to know what God certainly is not.

93
00:08:11,563 --> 00:08:12,768
Brothers and sisters,

94
00:08:12,793 --> 00:08:15,567
to promote better
understanding and integration

95
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,622
on simiarities between religions.

96
00:08:17,851 --> 00:08:19,923
As well as living in real hermony

97
00:08:19,985 --> 00:08:21,449

and my dear Brothers and Sisters,

107
00:08:51,237 --> 00:08:52,696
I welcome all of you

108
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,231

of Almighty God be on all of you.

113
00:09:04,783 --> 00:09:07,085
The Non-Muslims may be wondering

114
00:09:07,381 --> 00:09:10,264
that, what was I murmuring, or uttering

115
00:09:10,485 --> 00:09:12,081
in the beginning of my talk.

116
00:09:12,737 --> 00:09:15,321
I was not trying to mesmerize you,

117
00:09:15,347 --> 00:09:16,503
or hypnotize you,

118
00:09:16,961 --> 00:09:18,760
but I was reciting

119
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:20,990
few verses of the Holy Qur’an

120
00:09:21,038 --> 00:09:24,753
from Surah Taha, Ch. No. 20,

121
00:09:24,832 --> 00:09:26,880
verses No. 25 and 28.

122
00:09:27,299 --> 00:09:29,299
When Allah Subhana Wa Taala,

123
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:33,712
Almighty God asks Prophet
Moses (peace be upon him)

124
00:09:33,769 --> 00:09:36,727
to deliver the message to the Pharoah,

125
00:09:37,388 --> 00:09:39,261
Moses (peace be upon him),

126
00:09:39,325 --> 00:09:40,357
he prays

127
00:09:40,404 --> 00:09:42,563
to Almighty God, Allah Subhana Wa Taala,

128
00:09:42,674 --> 00:09:44,182
 and recites these verses.

129
00:09:44,496 --> 00:09:46,359
 (Arabic)

130
00:09:46,742 --> 00:09:47,923
‘Oh my Lord

131
00:09:47,972 --> 00:09:49,738
expand my breast for me,

132
00:09:49,818 --> 00:09:51,812
 Expand my center for me,

133
00:09:52,307 --> 00:09:53,974
 (Arabic)…

134
00:09:54,051 --> 00:09:56,492
And make my task easy for me,

135
00:09:56,541 --> 00:09:58,674
(Arabic)…

136
00:09:58,838 --> 00:10:02,151
And remove the impediment from my speech’.

137
00:10:03,047 --> 00:10:04,326
Since we know

138
00:10:04,419 --> 00:10:06,414
 that Prophet Moses (peace be upon him)

139
00:10:06,459 --> 00:10:08,387
was a stamerer, was a stuterer.

140
00:10:08,452 --> 00:10:10,774
 So he prays to the Almighty God

141
00:10:10,902 --> 00:10:12,931
to remove the stamering,

142
00:10:13,007 --> 00:10:14,360
to loosen his tongue,

143
00:10:14,549 --> 00:10:15,751
as well as

144
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:17,997
 remove the barrier,

145
00:10:18,213 --> 00:10:20,526
if there is any between him,

146
00:10:20,571 --> 00:10:22,204
and the person to whom

147
00:10:22,249 --> 00:10:23,701
he is going to deliver the message.

148
00:10:24,281 --> 00:10:25,709
If a person

149
00:10:25,913 --> 00:10:27,092
 is giving a talk,

150
00:10:27,217 --> 00:10:28,544
 on other religions,

151
00:10:28,964 --> 00:10:31,084
those people in the audience

152
00:10:31,164 --> 00:10:33,579
who do not belong to that religion,

153
00:10:33,682 --> 00:10:35,167
they may think

154
00:10:35,245 --> 00:10:37,570
that this person is going to speak

155
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:39,079
 against their Religion.

156
00:10:39,514 --> 00:10:40,841
For example,

157
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:42,610
if suppose,

158
00:10:42,746 --> 00:10:43,665
a Hindu

159
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:45,978
is giving a talk on other Religions,

160
00:10:46,384 --> 00:10:49,026
the Non-Hindus may feel that,

161
00:10:49,059 --> 00:10:52,057
he is going to speak against my Religion.

162
00:10:52,812 --> 00:10:54,168
If a Christian

163
00:10:54,197 --> 00:10:56,505
is giving a talk on other Religions,

164
00:10:56,857 --> 00:10:58,921
gions, the Non-Hindus may feel

165
00:10:59,043 --> 00:11:00,385
that, he is going to speak

166
00:11:00,465 --> 00:11:01,749
 against my Religion.

167
00:11:02,469 --> 00:11:03,638
Similarly,

168
00:11:03,775 --> 00:11:05,023
I being a Muslim,

169
00:11:05,237 --> 00:11:08,303
when I am giving a talk on other Religions,

170
00:11:08,742 --> 00:11:11,311
the Non-Muslims may feel that,

171
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:13,930
I am going to speak against their Religion.

172
00:11:14,188 --> 00:11:15,465
That is the reason,

173
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:18,090
I am praying to Allah Subhana Wa Taala,

174
00:11:18,154 --> 00:11:19,503
Almighty God,

175
00:11:19,862 --> 00:11:21,262
to loosen my tongue

176
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:24,155
as well as remove the impediment,

177
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:25,035
the barrier

178
00:11:25,143 --> 00:11:26,536
mental or otherwise,

179
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,981
if there is any, between me and you.

180
00:11:31,027 --> 00:11:32,145
The topic

181
00:11:32,221 --> 00:11:33,941
of this morning’s talk is…

182
00:11:34,073 --> 00:11:37,512
‘Concept of God in Major Religions’.

183
00:11:39,017 --> 00:11:40,062
‘Religion’

184
00:11:40,539 --> 00:11:42,404
according to the Oxford Dictionary means,

185
00:11:42,669 --> 00:11:43,700
‘A belief

186
00:11:43,978 --> 00:11:47,173
 in a Super Human controlling power,

187
00:11:47,304 --> 00:11:48,395
especially

188
00:11:48,574 --> 00:11:50,657
a personal God or gods,

189
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:53,534
that deserve obedience and worship’.

190
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:57,758
The Qari, Brother Ashraf Muhamedy,

191
00:11:57,896 --> 00:12:01,329
 he recited few verses of the Holy Qur’an

192
00:12:01,411 --> 00:12:02,760
from Surah Al Imran,

193
00:12:02,949 --> 00:12:06,123
Ch. No.3, V. No. 64, which says,

194
00:12:06,488 --> 00:12:08,015
(Arabic)

195
00:12:08,194 --> 00:12:09,632
‘Say to the people of the book'

196
00:12:09,871 --> 00:12:12,529
(Arabic)

197
00:12:12,718 --> 00:12:16,236
‘that come to common terms
as between us and you’

198
00:12:16,952 --> 00:12:18,077
Which is the first term?

199
00:12:18,143 --> 00:12:19,929
(Arabic)

200
00:12:19,968 --> 00:12:21,450
‘that we worship none but Allah’.

201
00:12:21,594 --> 00:12:23,473
(Arabic)

202
00:12:23,499 --> 00:12:25,549
‘that we associate no partners with Him’.

203
00:12:25,761 --> 00:12:29,306
(Arabic)

204
00:12:29,332 --> 00:12:31,977
‘that we erect not among ourselves,

205
00:12:32,069 --> 00:12:34,199
Lords and Patrons, other than Allah’.

206
00:12:34,397 --> 00:12:35,654
(Arabic)

207
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,791
…‘if then they turn back’.

208
00:12:36,884 --> 00:12:37,810
(Arabic)

209
00:12:37,878 --> 00:12:38,831
‘say we bear witness’.

210
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:40,158
(Arabic)

211
00:12:40,184 --> 00:12:41,705
‘that we are Muslims

212
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:44,046
bowing our will to Allah Subhana Wa Taala’.

213
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:47,317
This is a verse of the Holy Qur’an

214
00:12:47,395 --> 00:12:48,612
which shows you a way

215
00:12:48,652 --> 00:12:50,847
how to speak with people

216
00:12:50,927 --> 00:12:52,422
 of different communities.

217
00:12:53,264 --> 00:12:54,084
 It says :

218
00:12:54,318 --> 00:12:57,414
(Arabic)

219
00:12:57,627 --> 00:13:01,013
‘That came to common terms
as between us and you’.

220
00:13:02,175 --> 00:13:03,425
Which is the first term?

221
00:13:03,453 --> 00:13:05,074
(Arabic)

222
00:13:05,135 --> 00:13:06,655
‘That we worship none but Allah’

223
00:13:06,685 --> 00:13:08,374
(Arabic)

224
00:13:08,442 --> 00:13:10,982
‘that we associate no partners with Him’.

225
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:14,968
 One thing common

226
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:19,050
 in all the Major Religions

227
00:13:19,247 --> 00:13:23,034
of the world is, that

228
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:25,528
 the God they worship,

229
00:13:25,851 --> 00:13:30,091
they believe He is the same God for them,

230
00:13:30,122 --> 00:13:31,947
 as well as for the others.

231
00:13:31,973 --> 00:13:32,979
For example

232
00:13:33,466 --> 00:13:36,006
the God which the Hindus worship,

233
00:13:36,128 --> 00:13:37,040
they believe

234
00:13:37,224 --> 00:13:39,670
He is the same God for the Hindus

235
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,879
 as well as for the Non-Hindus.

236
00:13:42,752 --> 00:13:45,847
The God which the Christians worship,

237
00:13:46,062 --> 00:13:47,278
they believe

238
00:13:47,384 --> 00:13:48,587
He is the same God,

239
00:13:48,773 --> 00:13:51,710
for the Christians as well
as for the Non-Christians.

240
00:13:51,931 --> 00:13:53,320
Similarly

241
00:13:53,697 --> 00:13:56,078
the God…Allah Subhana Wa Taala

242
00:13:56,103 --> 00:13:57,804
 which we Muslims worship,

243
00:13:58,015 --> 00:13:58,907
we believe

244
00:13:59,019 --> 00:14:01,130
 He is the same Allah Subhana Wa Taala

245
00:14:01,162 --> 00:14:02,336
for the Muslims

246
00:14:02,361 --> 00:14:04,162
, as well as for the Non-Muslims.

247
00:14:07,583 --> 00:14:10,028
The Major Religions of the world

248
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:13,393
can be broadly classified as :

249
00:14:14,304 --> 00:14:15,748
Semetic Religions

250
00:14:15,859 --> 00:14:17,748
 and Non Semetic Religions.

251
00:14:18,761 --> 00:14:21,031
The Non Semetic Religions

252
00:14:21,222 --> 00:14:22,587
are further divided

253
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:25,524
 into Aryan and the Non Aryan Religions.

254
00:14:28,153 --> 00:14:29,724
The Semetic Religions

255
00:14:29,911 --> 00:14:31,244
are those Religions

256
00:14:31,276 --> 00:14:33,085
that are followed by the Semites.

257
00:14:33,483 --> 00:14:35,134
 Who are the Semites?

258
00:14:35,235 --> 00:14:38,039
The Semites are the descendents of ‘Shem’,

259
00:14:38,318 --> 00:14:41,641
who was the son of Prophet
Noah (Peace be upon him)

260
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:42,826
which is mentioned in the Bible,

261
00:14:42,851 --> 00:14:43,977
in the book Genesis

262
00:14:44,005 --> 00:14:45,761
 Ch. No. 5 and Ch.No. 11.

263
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:49,927
So Semetic Religions are those Religions,

264
00:14:49,955 --> 00:14:52,053
 that are followed by the Jews,

265
00:14:52,142 --> 00:14:54,178
by the Arabs, by the Asyrians

266
00:14:54,232 --> 00:14:55,342
 by the Ponysians

267
00:14:55,464 --> 00:14:58,119
who speak Hebrew,

268
00:14:58,265 --> 00:15:01,889
Aramaic, Arabic, Acadians, Ponysians, etc.

269
00:15:03,685 --> 00:15:06,109
 The major amongst

270
00:15:06,242 --> 00:15:08,482
 the Semetic Religions are,

271
00:15:08,517 --> 00:15:10,792
Judaism, Christianity and Islam.

272
00:15:10,821 --> 00:15:13,070
- all of which are Prophetic Religions.

273
00:15:13,539 --> 00:15:15,153
The Non Sematic Religions

274
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:16,467
 are further divided

275
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:19,624
 into Aryan and Non-Aryan Religions.

276
00:15:20,328 --> 00:15:23,833
The Aryan Religions, are the Religions

277
00:15:23,873 --> 00:15:26,598
followed by the Aryans -

278
00:15:26,623 --> 00:15:30,276
a group of Indo-European

279
00:15:30,301 --> 00:15:31,850
 speaking community,

280
00:15:32,619 --> 00:15:33,836
which spread

281
00:15:33,927 --> 00:15:36,453
in Iran and Northern India,

282
00:15:36,539 --> 00:15:39,462
in the 1st half of the 2nd millenium B.C,

283
00:15:39,487 --> 00:15:42,413
that is 2000 to 1500 B.C.

284
00:15:45,031 --> 00:15:48,020
The Aryan Religion is further divided

285
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:50,455
 into Vedic and Non - Vedic Religion.

286
00:15:51,475 --> 00:15:54,001
The Vedic religion is ‘Brahaminism’

287
00:15:54,349 --> 00:15:57,021
which has been given the
misnomer of Hindusium.

288
00:15:57,670 --> 00:16:00,117
The Non-Vedic Religions, are

289
00:16:00,183 --> 00:16:02,683
 Sikhism, Buddism, Jainism, etc.

290
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:08,739
 Amongst the Non-Aryan Religions,

291
00:16:08,815 --> 00:16:11,897
 we have those of the Chinese origin

292
00:16:12,145 --> 00:16:16,550
like ‘Taoism’, ‘Confusism’, etc -

293
00:16:16,785 --> 00:16:18,266
 those of the Japanese origin,

294
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:19,880
 like ‘Shintuism’, etc.

295
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:22,228
But most of these Religions,

296
00:16:22,576 --> 00:16:25,883
they do not have a concept of God.

297
00:16:26,158 --> 00:16:27,556
Therefore

298
00:16:27,782 --> 00:16:29,832
they are preferably called

299
00:16:29,857 --> 00:16:31,366
 as ethical systems,

300
00:16:31,393 --> 00:16:33,483
instead of Religions.

301
00:16:34,256 --> 00:16:37,748
As far as my talk today will be concerned,

302
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:41,919
 I will be speaking about he Concept of God

303
00:16:41,944 --> 00:16:43,348
in Major Religions,

304
00:16:43,373 --> 00:16:45,914
 of ‘Semetic’ and ‘Aryan’ origin.

305
00:16:49,057 --> 00:16:52,866
To understand the concept of God,

306
00:16:53,755 --> 00:16:58,213
the best and the most accurate way

307
00:16:58,642 --> 00:17:02,743
is to analyze their Religious Scriptures,

308
00:17:03,742 --> 00:17:07,803
and understand what it
has to speak about God.

309
00:17:08,723 --> 00:17:11,362
Trying to analyze the concept of God,

310
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:14,060
by looking at the followers

311
00:17:14,085 --> 00:17:15,628
s not always correct,

312
00:17:15,819 --> 00:17:17,863
because most of the followers

313
00:17:18,019 --> 00:17:22,602
hey themselves do not know what
their Scripture speaks about God.

314
00:17:23,664 --> 00:17:25,608
 So let's, analyze today,

315
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:28,927
the concept of God in Major Religions

316
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:32,260
by analyzing their Religious Scriptures.

317
00:17:34,105 --> 00:17:39,284
First we will discuss the Aryan Religion.

318
00:17:39,968 --> 00:17:45,762
Hinduism is the most popular
of all the Aryan religions.

319
00:17:48,621 --> 00:17:51,657
 And if you ask a common Hindu,

320
00:17:51,947 --> 00:17:54,765
 that… How many gods does he believe in?

321
00:17:55,261 --> 00:17:58,098
Some may say 3, some may say 33,

322
00:17:58,123 --> 00:17:59,457
some may say a 1000,

323
00:17:59,483 --> 00:18:00,786
 while the others may say,

324
00:18:00,811 --> 00:18:04,001
 33 crores, 330 million.

325
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:08,441
 But if you ask, a Hindu learned man,

326
00:18:08,608 --> 00:18:11,254
who knows his Religious Scriptures,

327
00:18:11,398 --> 00:18:12,548
he will tell you

328
00:18:12,575 --> 00:18:16,001
that a Hindu should actually
believe, only in one God.

329
00:18:18,698 --> 00:18:20,074
The major difference

330
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:23,340
between the common Hindu and the Muslim is

331
00:18:24,147 --> 00:18:25,589
that, the common Hindu

332
00:18:25,735 --> 00:18:27,401
believes in a Philosophy

333
00:18:27,428 --> 00:18:29,504
known as ‘Pantheism’

334
00:18:30,688 --> 00:18:32,686
that is, everything is God

335
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:34,041
The tree is God,

336
00:18:34,066 --> 00:18:34,958
the sun is God,

337
00:18:34,983 --> 00:18:35,990
the moon is God,

338
00:18:36,017 --> 00:18:36,856
the snake is God,

339
00:18:36,881 --> 00:18:37,706
 the monkey is God,

340
00:18:37,731 --> 00:18:38,761
 the human beings are God.

341
00:18:39,351 --> 00:18:43,346
The Muslim believes that
everything is God’s.

342
00:18:43,633 --> 00:18:45,750
God with an Apostofy ‘S’,

343
00:18:45,775 --> 00:18:47,357
everything belongs to God.

344
00:18:47,554 --> 00:18:48,863
The tree belongs to God,

345
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:49,988
the sun belongs to God,

346
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:51,228
the moon belongs to God,

347
00:18:51,253 --> 00:18:52,310
the snake belongs to God,

348
00:18:52,336 --> 00:18:53,580
the monkey belongs to God,

349
00:18:53,606 --> 00:18:54,883
the human beings belong to God.

350
00:18:55,607 --> 00:18:57,101
So the major difference

351
00:18:57,128 --> 00:18:58,490
between the common Hindu

352
00:18:58,515 --> 00:18:59,853
 and the Muslim, is

353
00:19:00,012 --> 00:19:01,361
the Apostofy ‘S’.

354
00:19:02,381 --> 00:19:04,709
The Hindus say, everything is God,

355
00:19:04,815 --> 00:19:07,196
and we Muslims say everything is God’s -

356
00:19:07,221 --> 00:19:09,401
God with a Apostofy ‘S’.

357
00:19:10,102 --> 00:19:12,774
If we can solve this difference

358
00:19:12,853 --> 00:19:14,374
  of Apostofy ‘S’,

359
00:19:14,727 --> 00:19:16,883
 the Hindus and the Muslims will be united.

360
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:20,097
How do you do it? As the Qur’an says,

361
00:19:20,122 --> 00:19:22,636
(Arabic)

362
00:19:22,946 --> 00:19:26,253
‘That come to common terms
as between us and you’.

363
00:19:26,405 --> 00:19:27,755
Which is the first term?

364
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:29,421
(Arabic)

365
00:19:29,448 --> 00:19:31,048
‘that we worship none but Allah’,

366
00:19:31,076 --> 00:19:32,611
(Arabic)

367
00:19:32,636 --> 00:19:34,792
‘that we associate no partners with Him’.

368
00:19:35,779 --> 00:19:36,982
So let us analyze

369
00:19:37,459 --> 00:19:40,197
he concept of God in Hinduisum,

370
00:19:40,223 --> 00:19:42,525
by analyzing their Religious Scriptures.

371
00:19:44,417 --> 00:19:46,573
The most popular amongst all the

372
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,994
Hindu Religious Scriptures,

373
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:51,004
is the ‘Bhagwat Geeta’.

374
00:19:51,824 --> 00:19:53,742
This is a copy of Bhagwat Geeta -

375
00:19:53,946 --> 00:19:58,205
In the IRF we have Alhamdulillah,

376
00:19:58,235 --> 00:20:01,952
more than 30 different translations
only of Bhagwat Geeta.

377
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:09,702
The Bhagwat Geeta says in
Ch.No. 7, V. No.20

378
00:20:09,913 --> 00:20:15,492
that "Those whose intelligence has
been stolen by material desires,

379
00:20:16,092 --> 00:20:17,894
they worship the demi Gods’ -

380
00:20:17,984 --> 00:20:20,753
That means the materialistic people,

381
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:22,352
they worship demiGods -

382
00:20:22,377 --> 00:20:25,774
That means not the true Almighty God.

383
00:20:28,417 --> 00:20:34,449
The Upanishads are the other
Sacred Scriptures of the Hindus.

384
00:20:34,478 --> 00:20:38,398
It is mentioned in the Chandogya Upanishad,

385
00:20:38,687 --> 00:20:42,457
Ch.No. 6, Section No. 2, Verse No.1.

386
00:20:42,484 --> 00:20:44,127
<font color="#caca00">‘Ekam Evidetium’…</font>

387
00:20:44,359 --> 00:20:46,947
‘God is one only…  not a second’

388
00:20:47,427 --> 00:20:49,260
That means - There is only God,

389
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:50,998
He doesn’t have any partner,

390
00:20:51,224 --> 00:20:52,414
 He is alone.

391
00:20:52,628 --> 00:20:54,009
Same as the Holy Qur’an

392
00:20:54,155 --> 00:20:57,885
which is mentioned in Surah Ikhlas, Ch.
No. 112, V. No.1,

393
00:20:57,952 --> 00:20:59,452
<font color="#caca00">Q'ul hu Allahu Ah'aad</font>

394
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:01,540
‘Say He is Allah, one and only’.

395
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:06,420
It is mentioned in the
Sweta Sutara Upanishad,

396
00:21:06,549 --> 00:21:09,541
Ch. No. 6, Verse No.9,

397
00:21:10,306 --> 00:21:13,664
<font color="#caca00">‘Na casya kasuj janita na cadhipah’,</font>

398
00:21:13,868 --> 00:21:14,781
which means….

399
00:21:14,933 --> 00:21:19,369
‘Of Him there is no parents, nor Lord’

400
00:21:19,499 --> 00:21:22,332
He has got no parents,
He has got no masters -

401
00:21:22,407 --> 00:21:24,574
That means, He alone is sufficient,

402
00:21:24,598 --> 00:21:26,995
He is not dependent on anyone else.

403
00:21:28,025 --> 00:21:30,208
As the Holy Qur’an says in Surah Ikhlas,

404
00:21:30,298 --> 00:21:32,656
Ch. No.112, V. No.3,

405
00:21:33,046 --> 00:21:35,118
<font color="#caca00">Lam yaalid, owalam youlaad</font>

406
00:21:35,144 --> 00:21:37,144
<font color="#caca00">‘He begets not nor is He begotten’ </font>

407
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:40,140
The quotation I gave from ‘Upanishads’,

408
00:21:40,264 --> 00:21:44,669
was translated by S. Radha Krishnan,

409
00:21:44,944 --> 00:21:47,772
and we have other translations
also in our foundation.

410
00:21:48,092 --> 00:21:49,113
Further, if you read

411
00:21:49,138 --> 00:21:51,157
in the Sweta Sutara
(Svetasavatara) Upanishads,

412
00:21:51,504 --> 00:21:56,187
 Ch. No. 4, V. No. 19, it says

413
00:21:56,232 --> 00:21:58,186
‘Natastiya Pratima Asti’
(Na tasya pratima asti)

414
00:21:58,717 --> 00:22:01,365
‘There is no likeness of Him’.

415
00:22:02,065 --> 00:22:04,684
Same as the Holy Qur’an, Surah Iklas,

416
00:22:04,714 --> 00:22:07,243
Ch. No. 112, Verse No. 4

417
00:22:07,392 --> 00:22:09,466
<font color="#caca00">"walam ya kullahu kufuwan Ahaad"</font>

418
00:22:09,572 --> 00:22:11,497
<font color="#caca00">‘There is nothing like Him’.</font>

419
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:15,058
 It is further mentioned in the next verse

420
00:22:15,186 --> 00:22:20,534
of the Sweta Sutara (Svetasvatara)
Upanishads, Ch.No.4 Verse No. 20,

421
00:22:21,177 --> 00:22:24,481
that…<font color="#caca00"> ‘His form cannot be seen,</font>

422
00:22:24,731 --> 00:22:26,845
<font color="#caca00">No one can see Him with the eyes’.</font>

423
00:22:28,509 --> 00:22:30,651
Similar to the message that
is given in holy Quran

424
00:22:30,676 --> 00:22:33,816
in Surah Anam, Ch.No.6, V.No.103…

425
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:38,763
<font color="#caca00">‘No vision can grasp Him,
but He grasps all vision, </font>

426
00:22:38,995 --> 00:22:43,261
<font color="#caca00">He is beyond comprehension,
yet He is acquainted with all things’.</font>

427
00:22:46,465 --> 00:22:49,382
Amongst all the Religious
Scriptures of the Hindus,

428
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:52,120
the most sacred are the Vedas,

429
00:22:52,457 --> 00:22:54,696
and there are principally 4 Vedas -

430
00:22:54,855 --> 00:22:59,082
the Rigved, the Ajurved,
the Samved, and the Atharvaved.

431
00:22:59,419 --> 00:23:02,455
 The Rigved deals with ‘Songs of praises’;

432
00:23:03,253 --> 00:23:06,527
the Ajurved deals with
‘Sacrificial formulas’,

433
00:23:06,658 --> 00:23:08,623
the Samved with Melody,

434
00:23:08,702 --> 00:23:11,321
and the Atharvaved with Magical formulas.

435
00:23:12,775 --> 00:23:17,953
It is mentioned in the Yajur Ved,
Ch. No. 32, Verse No. 3

436
00:23:18,181 --> 00:23:20,542
<font color="#caca00">'Na tasya pratima asti’</font>

437
00:23:21,123 --> 00:23:23,067
<font color="#caca00">There is no image of Him. </font>

438
00:23:23,226 --> 00:23:25,111
And verse continues and says

439
00:23:25,296 --> 00:23:29,780
that<font color="#caca00"> ‘He is unborn,
 and He should be worshipped’.</font>

440
00:23:30,971 --> 00:23:35,178
It is mentioned in the Yajurved,
 Ch. No. 40, V. No.8

441
00:23:35,297 --> 00:23:38,729
that<font color="#caca00"> ‘God in bodyless and Pure’. </font>

442
00:23:39,759 --> 00:23:44,144
It is mentioned in the Yajurveda,
Ch.No. 40, V.No.9,

443
00:23:44,245 --> 00:23:48,095
<font color="#caca00">‘Andasma Pravishanti Ya Sambhuti Upaste’,
(Andhatama pravishanti ye asambhuti mupaste) </font>

444
00:23:48,365 --> 00:23:49,337
which means –

445
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:54,268
‘They are entering darkness those
who worship the Asambuti’.

446
00:23:54,468 --> 00:23:58,365
The ‘Asambuti’ are the natural things
like air, water, fire.
