The Massacre of Karbala – A Historical Analysis by Shaykh Yasir Qadhi — An MIC and AlMaghrib Institute exclusive.

Muharram (1st Islamic month); normally a time of rejoice in Islamic tradition in reminiscing the rescue of Musa (alayhis salaam) and his people from the clutches of Fir’awn, but in the year 61 AH the Muslims faced one of their most agonizing moments…

“Is it appropriate for you to kill the likes of me? I am the son of the daughter of your Prophet. There is no other grandson of a prophet who remains on the face of the earth asides from me.”

Journey back in history to revisit one of the most controversial and misconstrued events in Islamic history: The Massacre of Karbala.

Are Sunnis ‘on the side of Yazid’ or ‘on the side of Husayn’? Who is to blame for the death of Husayn? Should we curse Yazid?

Join Shaykh Dr. Yasir Qadhi as he analyzes and contextualizes the events that led up to the martyrdom of al-Husayn (radiAllahu anhu), its occurrence and aftermath.



CLARIFICATION NOTICE: At 26 min 23 seconds of this video, Shaykh Dr. Yasir Qadhi made a sincere mistake and has clarified by stating: “I made a mistake; I was intending to refer to the incident of Harra in Madinah, but instead I mentioned the death of Ibn Al-Zubayr. Yazid was not able to deal with Ibn al-Zubayr in his lifetime. Rather, it was during the reign of Abd al-Malik b. Marwan that eventually Ibn al-Zubayr was killed.”
