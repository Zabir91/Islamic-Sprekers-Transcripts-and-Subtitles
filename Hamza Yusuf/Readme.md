Hamza Yusuf was born in the U.S.A - Washington state to a Catholic father and a Greek Orthodox mother. He was raised with eclectic ideas about God and religion, and baptised into Orthodox Church of the Greek Diocese in the States. 

Hamza began to study religious traditions at a young age (being curious), eventually leading to his discovery of Islam, the way of life he embraced at the age of 17. Thereafter he studied and travelled extensively in the Muslim world for ten years, to places like U.A.E, Saudi Arabia, as well as North and West Africa. Travelling in his search for acquring true knowledge of Islam and its branches of sciences.. his thirst for "golden knowledge" and "treasures for the seeker" led him to the uncorrupted desert bedoiun scholars in Africa who taught him true real authentic spiritual Islamic knowledge and enlightenment... the message of Islam... "Peace with himself, with his Creator, the environment, other living beings & creatures", based on works by great Islamic scholars of the past. 

He also became fluent in Arabic language and then began his studies of the traditional Islamic sciences under the tutelage of some of the greatest Muslim scholars of our age. He received teaching licenses in various Islamic subjects from several well-known scholars in various countries.

After Ten years of studies and learning he returned to the USA and completed his Western education, obtaining a degree in Religious Studies at San Jose State University in California and a degree in Health Care.
