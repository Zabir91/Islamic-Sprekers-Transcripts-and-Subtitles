00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,570
Rehema salatu was-salam a disease you

2
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:45,080
know Mohamed when he was happy he was

3
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:47,900
sudden Testament kathira behind a layer

4
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:50,390
of God I mean along after Elena hikmah

5
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:52,400
Tech when Charlene are emitted and

6
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,070
jarred every crumb first of all I want

7
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:59,750
to thank the the hosts all of the

8
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:02,570
distinguished professors that are here

9
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:07,610
this wonderful center of knowledge which

10
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:10,460
I was made to understand that this is

11
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:16,760
the largest university in Malaysia this

12
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:20,510
is also a wonderful auditorium to be

13
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:22,430
speaking and also to see so many young

14
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:27,650
faces out here it always inspires me to

15
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:32,140
see the young people that are willing to

16
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:37,250
come out to hear a discussion or a

17
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:40,220
lecture or to participate in something

18
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:42,500
of that nature as opposed to spending

19
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:46,010
their evening watching television which

20
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:48,470
is what a lot of people tend to do these

21
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:53,590
days the the topic and I think dr. Dell

22
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:59,110
was spoke very eloquently towards the

23
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:06,620
the the purpose of the evening we we

24
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:11,810
also prepared some thoughts for an

25
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:16,070
academic audience and I I think there's

26
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:19,220
quite a few students here so we're gonna

27
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:21,890
modify what I was going to talk about a

28
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:26,360
little bit but the the basic idea of the

29
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:30,530
crisis of knowledge is that there are

30
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:32,989
many problems in the world we have

31
00:02:32,989 --> 00:02:36,470
economic problems currently we have very

32
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:38,450
serious political problems one of the

33
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:40,130
problems that we have right now is in

34
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:42,889
Ukraine which in some ways is is a

35
00:02:42,889 --> 00:02:46,190
deeply troubling crisis right now

36
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:47,520
because

37
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,220
these are the the situations that in the

38
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:54,020
past have very easily led to major

39
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:57,030
conflagrations people tend to forget

40
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:02,070
that it was the assassination of the

41
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:07,050
heir of the Habsburg Empire that ignited

42
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:09,300
World War one which led to countless

43
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:13,470
deaths that it was the German invasion

44
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:16,290
of Poland which they considered actually

45
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:20,610
to be leoben's bomb or German living

46
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:24,800
room they were reconquest

47
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:28,350
german empire that was dismantled after

48
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:30,960
World War one and people tend to forget

49
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,510
that World War two was actually a direct

50
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:40,500
result of World War one and the the

51
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,600
utter humiliation that the Germans

52
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,570
suffered at the hands of the the

53
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:47,370
conquering powers at the Treaty of

54
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:50,790
Versailles so these events led to over a

55
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:52,430
hundred million people being killed

56
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:55,440
during the twentieth century but if you

57
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,030
actually look at these problems they

58
00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:01,620
were always a failure of the political

59
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:04,830
class at solving problems that were in

60
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:06,780
essence not just simply political

61
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:09,390
problems but but deeper than that and

62
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:11,880
this is part of the the the trouble that

63
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:15,660
we have is that we no longer define our

64
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:21,170
terms anymore we no longer look at these

65
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:25,770
human illnesses that we have at a deep

66
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:27,210
level we look at them at a very

67
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:29,550
superficial level and so we have

68
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:31,890
economic problems but they're addressed

69
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:35,160
at a very superficial level for instance

70
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:39,570
the recent massive crises which burn a

71
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:42,090
key member knacait who was the head of

72
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:43,919
the Federal Reserve Bank in the United

73
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:46,710
States and did his PhD on the Great

74
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:49,740
Depression recently came out admitting

75
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:52,710
that the financial crisis of 2008 was

76
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:55,169
greater than the financial crisis of

77
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:58,650
1929 October 1929 that began the Great

78
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:01,090
Depression but instead of a

79
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:04,840
seeing the problem at the roots instead

80
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:09,120
what was done was to ignore the the deep

81
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,100
problems of the financial structures and

82
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:15,880
institutions and to simply bail out the

83
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,850
criminals that perpetrated great

84
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:21,310
financial crimes against large numbers

85
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:23,590
of people not just in the United States

86
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:25,630
but around the globe and there were

87
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:27,370
people here in Malaysia that were

88
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:30,510
affected by that crises the Irish people

89
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:34,870
were made to bail out banks in in in

90
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:36,790
mainland Europe that had nothing to do

91
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:39,310
with with Ireland but their political

92
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:42,370
class accepted this one of the few

93
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:44,229
countries that actually did anything was

94
00:05:44,229 --> 00:05:47,919
Iceland where they put the banksters in

95
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:52,030
jail so the and and they refused to pay

96
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:54,700
the English banks for crimes that were

97
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:57,340
committed against their population by

98
00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:00,160
people that were unethical so instead of

99
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,320
addressing the economic problems at a

100
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,820
deep philosophical level which is

101
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:08,110
understanding first and foremost the

102
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:10,360
economic system that you have at its

103
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:13,780
philosophical base because any

104
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:16,139
institution in you has has a

105
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:18,880
philosophical understanding there's a

106
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,090
philosophy behind consumerism there's a

107
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:25,090
philosophy behind capitalism there is a

108
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:29,979
philosophy behind despotism and unless

109
00:06:29,979 --> 00:06:31,960
you understand the philosophies behind

110
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,780
those when when the problems of those

111
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:37,360
institutions arise you can't address

112
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,320
them properly

113
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,360
because you don't understand the problem

114
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:43,380
any physician knows that etiology and

115
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:46,120
diagnosis go together you have to

116
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,039
understand what caused the disease

117
00:06:48,039 --> 00:06:51,419
before you can treat the disease and you

118
00:06:51,419 --> 00:06:54,460
cannot if you if somebody comes to you

119
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:56,530
with malaria and you treat them for

120
00:06:56,530 --> 00:06:58,210
malaria and then you send them back to

121
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:01,840
the malarial swamp to simply be

122
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,720
reinfected again that is not treating a

123
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,800
person that's not treating the cause and

124
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,340
so looking at a deeper problem it's very

125
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:14,190
important now one of the May

126
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:16,440
problems in the crises of knowledge is

127
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:20,100
that knowledge has been defined by a

128
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:23,130
materialistic hegemonic civilization

129
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:25,320
that does not know that does not

130
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:29,790
acknowledge other forms of knowledge so

131
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:34,980
for instance in our tradition as well as

132
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:37,650
the tradition that dr. Delp was trained

133
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:39,900
in it which is the the the Catholic

134
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:42,500
tradition in our tradition our

135
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,060
epistemology is very different from the

136
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:48,090
epistemological assumptions of the

137
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:50,400
current dominant model around the globe

138
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,980
but if we don't understand the

139
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:55,350
epistemological some assumptions if we

140
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:57,660
simply go to these universities and we

141
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:59,220
imbibe what's being taught without

142
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:01,080
having the critical skills to understand

143
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,420
and analysis and analyze these things

144
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:06,990
then we become victims of world views

145
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:10,470
that were engendered by others that do

146
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:12,840
not share the same first principles that

147
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,540
we share if we don't know our first

148
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:17,460
principles if we don't know what our

149
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,560
methodologies are if we don't know what

150
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,990
the epistemology of Islam is if we don't

151
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:25,050
know how we view truth and what is truth

152
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:27,510
if we don't know these things then

153
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:30,930
they're easily that ignorant is easily

154
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:33,270
replaced by another type of ignorant

155
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:35,849
which is a compounded ignorant it's

156
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:37,700
learning things that are simply wrong

157
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:40,409
our scholars differentiated between

158
00:08:40,409 --> 00:08:42,960
simple ignorance and between compounded

159
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:45,150
ignorance al-jihad America

160
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:49,260
well jihad Basile jihad Vasya is a is

161
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:51,060
the ignorance that somebody who knows

162
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:53,790
they're ignorant has and this doctor

163
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:55,590
knew people I'll pass calls it innocent

164
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:57,660
ignorant it's something that can be

165
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:01,860
remedied but compounded ignorance is an

166
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,690
ignorance where somebody is ignorant and

167
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:05,520
they're also ignorant of their ignorance

168
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:09,930
and this is this is a much deeper

169
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:12,089
problem and so one of the great

170
00:09:12,089 --> 00:09:15,839
tragedies of of modern human beings we

171
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,260
have a cult film in the United States

172
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:21,450
which is called The Wizard of Oz which

173
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:23,910
every American child has to see year

174
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:25,740
after year until they're fully

175
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,570
indoctrinated into

176
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:30,150
the worldview of The Wizard of Oz but

177
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:32,010
one of the things about the Wizard of Oz

178
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:34,290
is there's a scarecrow who's looking for

179
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:38,490
a brain and he says if I only had a

180
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:40,200
brain with the thoughts I I'd be

181
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,750
thinking I could be another Lincoln if I

182
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:43,590
only had a brain

183
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:46,110
so he's looking for a brain well he

184
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:47,970
never finds the brain but at the end the

185
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:51,720
wizard gives him a piece of paper and he

186
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,960
says in in in in my country back home in

187
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,000
Kansas when somebody doesn't have a

188
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:03,530
brain we confer upon him a diploma and

189
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:07,200
and this is very often what happens in

190
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,360
our universities brainless people are

191
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,910
given pieces of paper to convince them

192
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:15,030
that they have a brain but the reality

193
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:18,330
of it is they're actually more ignorant

194
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:20,970
coming out of the university than they

195
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:22,590
were going in because when they went

196
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:24,780
into the university they had innocent

197
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:27,270
ignorant but by the time they come out

198
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:29,220
of the university they have this

199
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:32,370
compounded ignorance and this is one of

200
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:35,520
to me one of the great crimes of the

201
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:38,460
modern educational institutions that

202
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:40,940
people are deprived of a true education

203
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:43,260
they're given what they think is an

204
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:48,030
education Educare a to lead out of you

205
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:50,790
cannot teach people what they don't

206
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:54,510
already know that learning in our

207
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:58,350
tradition is remembering its tobeco it's

208
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:00,630
a recollection of something that we

209
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:02,880
already know and this is why the Quran

210
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:07,020
says what you remind make them remember

211
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:08,910
what they already knew what is it that

212
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:12,660
we already knew we knew a covenant that

213
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:16,350
we took in another dimension it was a

214
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:20,070
sacred covenant and it began with us to

215
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:23,430
be Arabic home am I not your Lord and we

216
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:25,770
replied as spirits we replied in the

217
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:26,520
affirmative

218
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:31,200
badda shahid 'no indeed you are our Lord

219
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,960
and we witness to this were brought into

220
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:37,110
this world and the world is a place of

221
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:39,820
remembrance it is to remember

222
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:43,530
a previous existence it is to recollect

223
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:47,050
to recall this is why we called vicaroo

224
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:49,120
law Niccolo law because we're

225
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,820
remembering what we already knew you

226
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:53,890
cannot remember something that you did

227
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:56,890
not know previously and this is the

228
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:58,750
highest form of knowledge in our

229
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:01,000
tradition it is to know your Lord

230
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,150
Hanuman who la ilaha illaAllah this is

231
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:06,100
not being taught in the modern

232
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,350
institutions of learning they have

233
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:11,440
completely removed God from academia

234
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,460
they have removed God from the social

235
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:17,830
sciences they have removed God from the

236
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:19,630
physical sciences and they have

237
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:23,430
certainly removed God from the ethical

238
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:28,120
traditions that are taught today and he

239
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,640
inevitably lead for anybody that has an

240
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:33,520
intellect to moral relativism based on

241
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:36,520
how they're taught so in the Muslim

242
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:41,130
world we have adopted alien worldviews

243
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:45,040
these are not the worldviews of our own

244
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,310
tradition they have been given to us by

245
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:50,200
people that have come to certain

246
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,840
conclusions about the world one of them

247
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:55,750
is that the world is purely the material

248
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:58,540
world it's a quantitative world and this

249
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:01,180
is why they may worship the quantitative

250
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:03,940
sciences / the qualitative sciences but

251
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:06,520
in the Islamic tradition while a human

252
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:09,360
being is meant to be literate in both

253
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,800
qualitative and quantitative aspects of

254
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,230
life because we are beings of meaning

255
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:16,780
but dimension we have comprehension and

256
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:19,480
extension we have quality and we have

257
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:22,770
quantity and therefore both of them are

258
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:25,960
important to have literate people but

259
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,670
also to have numerate people is

260
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:30,310
important and this is why the numerous

261
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:32,560
Sciences the the quantitative Sciences

262
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,840
are important but our tradition always

263
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:37,120
gave precedent over the qualitative

264
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,030
sciences and and the single most

265
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:42,520
important of all these Sciences was

266
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:46,300
language language this is what makes us

267
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:49,210
human what makes us human is that we are

268
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:50,899
articulate beings

269
00:13:50,899 --> 00:13:53,209
we are beings that can communicate but

270
00:13:53,209 --> 00:13:55,339
what is the secret of our communication

271
00:13:55,339 --> 00:13:58,040
when we were told in the Quran in eg

272
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,759
inferred or the Haditha the Angels asked

273
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:05,029
Allah to geography Haman you see to see

274
00:14:05,029 --> 00:14:07,759
how hysterical Dima will you put in the

275
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:10,790
earth those who sow corruption and shed

276
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:12,499
blood it's interesting that their

277
00:14:12,499 --> 00:14:14,540
question involved corruption and

278
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:16,670
shedding blood which look around the

279
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:18,860
globe now how widespread these two

280
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:22,809
phenomena are corruption and bloodshed

281
00:14:22,809 --> 00:14:26,089
we have corruption unfortunately but the

282
00:14:26,089 --> 00:14:28,519
Muslim countries the the corruption

283
00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:30,170
indices that are done in the

284
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:32,779
Scandinavian countries on a yearly basis

285
00:14:32,779 --> 00:14:34,910
the Muslim countries are some of the

286
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:37,399
most corrupt they are in fact considered

287
00:14:37,399 --> 00:14:40,040
to be the most corrupt countries in the

288
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:44,420
world in fact on average Nigeria is

289
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:48,110
always takes first place and Pakistan

290
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:50,089
generally comes in second but I have a

291
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:52,249
Pakistani friend who informed me that

292
00:14:52,249 --> 00:14:54,800
the Pakistanis bribed the Nigerians to

293
00:14:54,800 --> 00:15:00,620
take first place so this this is a big

294
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:04,220
problem this is a major problem that we

295
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:08,660
have now the other is the shedding of

296
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:10,519
blood and the so the Angels asked this

297
00:15:10,519 --> 00:15:12,559
question this is stiff hem it's not at

298
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:15,290
all they're asking to understand because

299
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:17,089
they were looking at the beings that

300
00:15:17,089 --> 00:15:18,980
were on earth before humans which were

301
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:21,429
the jinn and this is what the jinn did

302
00:15:21,429 --> 00:15:24,139
the jinn were here before us and they

303
00:15:24,139 --> 00:15:26,240
they they they they were corrupt and

304
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,550
they shed blood and so the human being

305
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:31,249
was put here to replace them now what's

306
00:15:31,249 --> 00:15:34,100
interesting about this replacement that

307
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,980
the the angel said when a newness of the

308
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:40,459
no subtlety home decor nobody Sulak we

309
00:15:40,459 --> 00:15:44,569
praise you and we deem you holy and

310
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:47,209
transcendent beyond any description that

311
00:15:47,209 --> 00:15:50,329
this is what we do unless is called any

312
00:15:50,329 --> 00:15:53,509
animal Mallett at the moon I know what

313
00:15:53,509 --> 00:15:55,369
you do not know and this is important

314
00:15:55,369 --> 00:15:56,949
that the word that is used is I know

315
00:15:56,949 --> 00:15:59,260
what you do not know

316
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:01,540
and then the very next thing is while

317
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:06,960
Emma Adam and a smile and God taught man

318
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:11,800
Adam all of the names this this is the

319
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:14,410
secret of the human being that we have

320
00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:18,070
the ability to abstract we have the

321
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:20,620
ability to see the one in the many the

322
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:23,260
only way that we can communicate is by

323
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:26,440
seeing the one in the many when we talk

324
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:30,100
when we talk about a lecture so you you

325
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,720
you knew that there was a lecture

326
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,220
tonight how do you know what a lecture

327
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:35,830
is how do you know what a lecture is if

328
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:38,620
I say there's a lecture on the crises of

329
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:41,110
knowledge how do you know what a crisis

330
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:43,260
is how do you know what knowledge is

331
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:46,540
because you have abstracted the one out

332
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:48,610
of the many there are many types of

333
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:51,850
crises but they share common qualities

334
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:54,850
and that enables us to speak

335
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:58,630
intelligently about the oneness the the

336
00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:02,620
unified nature of crises it enables us

337
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:04,869
to speak about the unified nature of

338
00:17:04,869 --> 00:17:08,230
knowledge we are unifiers by nature this

339
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:10,180
is what we do as human beings we are

340
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:12,699
Milwaukee dune we are constantly making

341
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:15,520
one and how do we make one we make one

342
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,470
through language we can only communicate

343
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:19,959
because of the oneness of language and

344
00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:23,470
this is why the ultimate abstraction is

345
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:26,890
to recognize that this diverse creation

346
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:33,480
also has a source just as every crises

347
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:37,900
we can abstract the essence of a crisis

348
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:40,480
we can abstract the essence of a crises

349
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,630
out of all these diverse crises we can

350
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:47,220
also abstract the essence of existence

351
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:50,140
out of all this diversity and the

352
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:54,040
essence of existence is Allah subhana wa

353
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:59,320
ta'ala this is this is our lord he is

354
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,570
not creation he is the creator of

355
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:04,180
creation but it's through his creation

356
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:06,010
that we know him

357
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:09,130
as the crises of knowledge we have

358
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:14,350
failed to see our Lord in his creation

359
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:18,430
we have failed to see our Lord in this

360
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:21,670
extraordinary theater of manifestation

361
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:24,640
that he has given us to come to know him

362
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,170
in the short time that we tarry here

363
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:32,680
Muslims are a theö centric civilization

364
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:35,980
our lives are meant to revolve around

365
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:40,180
God we are becoming like other previous

366
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:42,370
civilizations a narcissistic

367
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:45,210
civilization a civilization that

368
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:49,770
revolves around me this is the the child

369
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:52,570
civilization this is the age of the

370
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:54,970
child we're living in the age of the

371
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:58,150
infant but this is a tyrannical infant

372
00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:00,970
it's not because we look at children we

373
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:03,040
have in English we talk about I don't

374
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,200
know if you have this distinction in the

375
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,060
Malay language but in English we talk

376
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:12,040
about childlike and childish childlike

377
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:15,160
is a very positive quality but childish

378
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,800
is a very negative quality because a

379
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,990
child has an innocence that we all

380
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:21,760
recognize because it has yet to be

381
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,220
tainted by the world

382
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:28,360
it's a sinless being but the childís

383
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,640
nature the childish nature is the

384
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,460
tyrannical nature of the self this is

385
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:34,480
enough son Amata

386
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,090
this is the nufs this is the ego that

387
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:39,850
does not share this is the ego that sees

388
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:42,190
that it is the only thing in existence

389
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:43,960
and everything is peripheral to its own

390
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:46,420
existence this is what the child needs

391
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:48,820
to be educated out of this is the

392
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:52,360
essence of Education is to draw the true

393
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,850
nature the true innocence of the child

394
00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:58,420
the Bharata alia of the child into

395
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:00,790
existence and this is done in our

396
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:03,220
tradition we have no word that that

397
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:05,920
corresponds to the word education there

398
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,840
is no word in the history of Islam that

399
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,640
corresponds to the English word

400
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:12,460
education we have two concepts or always

401
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:14,020
kept together tarbiyah

402
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:18,330
with talam the idea of nurturing

403
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:21,480
the idea of educating in other words you

404
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,670
cannot separate the nurturing process

405
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:26,250
from the process of Education and this

406
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:27,900
is why they were always they went

407
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,340
together the more upbeat

408
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:31,860
the more active the more on them went

409
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:34,710
together the teacher was a spiritual

410
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:36,960
mentor as well as being an intellectual

411
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,540
mentor you cannot separate the spirit

412
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:42,180
from the intellect because the intellect

413
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:43,890
in and of itself is a spiritual

414
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:45,660
phenomenon it is not a material

415
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:48,810
phenomenon consciousness is spiritual

416
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:53,250
the the the very the very center of the

417
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:55,950
human being this core that that Allah

418
00:20:55,950 --> 00:21:00,170
calls the lube una al-bab is a

419
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:02,970
immaterial reality it is a spiritual

420
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:06,690
reality and so the the Merapi was the

421
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:09,690
the one who took you by degrees who

422
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:11,160
brought you out of yourself

423
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,950
and this is why madrasa in arabic means

424
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:16,620
the place of effacement it's the place

425
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:19,290
where the negative qualities are effaced

426
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:21,510
and the positive qualities are

427
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:24,180
inculcated they called the first stage

428
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:25,800
of education <font color="#54D130">Talia</font>

429
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:28,560
the emptying out of the self and the

430
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:31,530
second stage was <font color="#54D130">Tahlia</font> the adorning of

431
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:33,930
the self with those beautiful qualities

432
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:37,560
what the ancients called truth

433
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:41,280
goodness and beauty. What we call Iman

434
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:45,480
Islam and Ihsan. An Iman is our truth,

435
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:50,070
there is no god but Allah. Islam is the

436
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:52,590
way, that we behave with goodness in the

437
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:58,910
world. And Ihsan, is the profound

438
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:02,610
need for the human being to make things

439
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:05,220
beautiful and also to recognize beauty.

440
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:07,740
and this is the human

441
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:11,310
condition. But if you look at the current

442
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:14,610
world today, everywhere you look there

443
00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:18,630
are two powers ruling. There is the

444
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:20,850
irascible power and concupiscent power. 

445
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:25,110
There's the dog soul,

446
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:27,030
This is what Imam al-Gazzali called the

447
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:28,570
dog soul and the

448
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:32,049
Pig soul. These are the two powers that

449
00:22:32,049 --> 00:22:34,000
are reigning. The people that are

450
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,289
consuming and not recognizing that their

451
00:22:38,289 --> 00:22:40,450
consumption is killing them. And then the

452
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:43,899
people that are effecting their rage on

453
00:22:43,899 --> 00:22:48,730
the world. literally going out and

454
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:51,850
with rage in the world.

455
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:54,909
The war mongers whether they're

456
00:22:54,909 --> 00:22:58,059
spreading the weapons of war and we know

457
00:22:58,059 --> 00:23:00,429
in our tradition that it's prohibited to

458
00:23:00,429 --> 00:23:02,740
sell weapons during times of civil

459
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:05,769
strife. In fiqh, the vast majority of

460
00:23:05,769 --> 00:23:07,690
ulama said it's prohibited to sell

461
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:09,960
weapons when people are fighting. Because

462
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,610
Islam does not encourage fighting.

463
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:15,970
It encourages ending fighting.

464
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:19,029
<font color="#54D130"Kuna or other not on it how to be how

465
00:23:19,029 --> 00:23:19,330
long</font>

466
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:22,690
Every time they raise the flames of

467
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:25,480
fire, God put those flames out. Muslims

468
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,980
are supposed to want to put the flames

469
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:29,320
of war out, not to ignite the flames of

470
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,690
war. This verse that was recited at the

471
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:32,769
beginning and it was an interesting

472
00:23:32,769 --> 00:23:35,710
choice from from surat at Tawba. But

473
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:37,539
this verse that was recited to be is a

474
00:23:37,539 --> 00:23:40,149
good example. You see and the Quran

475
00:23:40,149 --> 00:23:41,830
says <font color="#54D130">....</font> You

476
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:43,840
know they the disbelievers will find

477
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,450
harshness in these people. This is only

478
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:49,899
during actual fighting. But there are now

479
00:23:49,899 --> 00:23:52,210
Muslims that believe that this is simply

480
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:54,460
the way we're supposed to behave with

481
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:57,879
non-Muslims. Whereas the the Quran tells

482
00:23:57,879 --> 00:23:59,830
us <font color="#54D130">....
483
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:03,070
.... </font>, That God doesn't prohibit

484
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:06,429
you from showing those who don't oppose

485
00:24:06,429 --> 00:24:11,200
you and persecute you religiously. Right?

486
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,809
Until <font color="#54D130"> ... </font>

487
00:24:13,809 --> 00:24:15,850
that you show righteousness towards them.

488
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:17,649
And that you actually give them a

489
00:24:17,649 --> 00:24:19,450
portion of your wealth. This is what Qadi

490
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:21,370
Abu Bakar and his Ahkamul Quran says.

491
00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:23,440
<font color="#54D130"> ....</font> means to be just. But

492
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,600
he also says <font color="#54D130"> .... </font>

493
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,549
That you can actually help them

494
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:29,230
when they're in need. We just recently

495
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:31,840
I've been mentioning this for years but

496
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,460
just recently, I was glad to see

497
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:35,409
there's a Turkish filmmaker that wants

498
00:24:35,409 --> 00:24:37,870
to make a film highlighting the fact and

499
00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:41,020
that in the 1840s in 1847,

500
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:44,140
the great Ottoman Sultan Abdul

501
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:49,410
Majeed sent shiploads of

502
00:24:49,410 --> 00:24:52,780
aid to the Irish during the Irish Famine

503
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:56,950
and and set pounds money to help them.

504
00:24:56,950 --> 00:25:00,610
This was before the

505
00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:03,280
idea of global charity. This was before

506
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,930
the idea of actually helping other

507
00:25:04,930 --> 00:25:08,440
people and I would challenge anybody to

508
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:11,410
show me many examples of this in human

509
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:13,180
history where people are suffering in

510
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:15,010
one place and people in another place

511
00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:16,810
find out about it and want to help them

512
00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:19,360
out. This is a very modern phenomenon, The

513
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:23,230
idea of aid. But Sultan Abdul Majeed he

514
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:25,780
had an Irish doctor, who told him about

515
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:27,730
the suffering of the Irish people during

516
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:30,370
the potato famine and the

517
00:25:30,370 --> 00:25:32,860
anglo-saxon people in England were not

518
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:35,470
only helping them, but in fact they

519
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:37,600
were actually happy about it because it

520
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,340
was removing a problem that they had.

521
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:41,710
which is the Irish problems. You don't

522
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:43,870
believe me just read a modest proposal

523
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:46,600
by Jonathan Swift to see, although

524
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:49,900
it's a sarcastic piece, it identifies the

525
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:52,270
sentiment of many English about the

526
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:55,510
Irish. So this ship was sent to Ireland

527
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:59,080
and the English were so bothered by it,

528
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:01,390
they actually prohibited from being

529
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:04,590
allowed to dock in 

530
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:09,070
their Shores in Ireland. So the

531
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:10,540
English that were controlling Ireland at

532
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:13,570
the time, did not want to the aid from

533
00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:16,180
Turkey to come to the Irish. And so they

534
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:18,160
had to the Ottomans went down and they

535
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,980
snuck it into a southern harbor. And that

536
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:23,710
city today has a plaque reminding people

537
00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:27,940
of that fact, that this is 

538
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:30,940
mercy and this is based on a Quranic

539
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:33,190
injunction that, human beings wherever

540
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:35,500
they are should be helped. Algeria during

541
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:38,680
the Great Famine of France, at the

542
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,510
beginning of the 19th century, out the

543
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:42,980
bay of Algeria sent

544
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:47,059
massive amounts of wheat from Algeria to

545
00:26:47,059 --> 00:26:49,730
France to help them. Because they were

546
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:51,170
suffering even though they were their

547
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:53,420
enemies at the time. But there's

548
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:55,910
something that transcends the animosity

549
00:26:55,910 --> 00:26:58,760
of politics and that is the necessity

550
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:02,450
for us to reveal our humanity, to be

551
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:04,850
<font color="#54D130"> ... </font> to be people that do

552
00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:07,220
beautiful acts of goodness, of kindness.

553
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:09,530
This is the essence of human

554
00:27:09,530 --> 00:27:11,600
beings. The prophet (SAM)

555
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,700
was called a mercy to all the

556
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:15,710
world. While <font color="#54D130"> .... </font>

557
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:18,350
we only sent you as a

558
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:21,050
mercy to all the worlds. This is our

559
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:24,050
prophet, he was a mercy. In fact 

560
00:27:24,050 --> 00:27:26,720
you have a brilliant Afghani scholar

561
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,520
here and you're fortunate to have him

562
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:33,230
Dr. Kamali, who writes extensively on 

563
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:35,570
<font color="#54D130"> .... Sharia </font>. I had the good fortune

564
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:37,309
of having lunch with him today. But one

565
00:27:37,309 --> 00:27:38,929
of the things that he says is the two

566
00:27:38,929 --> 00:27:42,230
fundamental <font color="#54D130">.... </font> of Islam are <font color="#54D130">Rahma</font> and

567
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:46,309
<font color="#54D130">Huda</font> mercy and guidance. And I would

568
00:27:46,309 --> 00:27:48,440
argue that really they can be collapsed

569
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,720
into one because guidance in itself

570
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,030
is a mercy, that the reason God has given

571
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:55,370
us guidance is because he's merciful. And

572
00:27:55,370 --> 00:27:57,530
the Quran begins <font color="#54D130">Bismillahir Rahmanir

573
00:27:57,530 --> 00:27:59,530
Rahim</font>. It doesn't begin

574
00:27:59,530 --> 00:28:01,850
Bismillah ar Rahman al Hady

575
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:05,059
It begins Bismillah ar-Rahman ar-Rahim

576
00:28:05,059 --> 00:28:07,730
to emphasize using two attributes of

577
00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:10,010
mercy. But that is the essence of our

578
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:12,410
Lord is mercy and the essence of His

579
00:28:12,410 --> 00:28:16,040
Prophet is mercy. And so Muslims this is

580
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,059
the <font color="#54D130">tarbiyah </font>

581
00:28:17,059 --> 00:28:19,850
<font color="#54D130">Terbiyah </font> is inculcating mercy. It's taking

582
00:28:19,850 --> 00:28:22,370
the child out of its cruelty. It's taking

583
00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:25,820
it out of its selfishness into a sharing

584
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:28,280
creature, a creature that wants to serve

585
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:31,010
others instead of be served by others.

586
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:33,890
And then the <font color="#54D130">.... </font> is the hooda. So

587
00:28:33,890 --> 00:28:36,020
<font color="#54D130">tarbiyah</font> and<font color="#54D130">....</font> name is Rahma and

588
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:39,890
huda. Its mercy and guidance. This is

589
00:28:39,890 --> 00:28:41,830
the essence of our tradition. And

590
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:45,200
guidance is something that we

591
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,160
cannot live without.

592
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,920
And because we're imitative creatures we

593
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:51,980
imitate what we see. Now we have demons

594
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:55,830
teaching our children. We have demons.

595
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:57,870
if anybody came to your house and

596
00:28:57,870 --> 00:29:00,270
knocked on the door and you opened it up

597
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:02,990
and they looked like Madonna or

598
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:06,950
Britney Spears or any of these people,

599
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:10,020
Russell Brand; you know these

600
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:11,580
people because we're in a global

601
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:14,280
civilization. But if any of them knocked

602
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:16,950
on your door and said, "excuse me. Do you

603
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:19,170
mind if I come inside and just entertain

604
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:22,500
your children for a few hours." which mad

605
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,780
person would say, oh of course ....

606
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:26,490
Even with the wonderful Malay

607
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:28,470
hospitality you wouldn't do that.

608
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:30,330
You'd say get the hell out of here and

609
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:33,150
you would slam the door on them.

610
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:34,920
who does he think he is or who does she

611
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:37,650
think you. And yet so many of us simply

612
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:40,590
turn on the television, and plop these

613
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:42,600
little children in front of this

614
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:47,600
mindless box. And and literally allow a

615
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,650
stranger's from a whole other

616
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:51,870
civilization, with a whole other set of

617
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:55,530
agendas to raise our children.

618
00:29:55,530 --> 00:29:59,750
I was once studying the Disney Channel.

619
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:02,190
Because Disney Channel is everywhere and

620
00:30:02,190 --> 00:30:04,110
it really struck me as odd that

621
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:07,170
this obsession with spreading your

622
00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:08,550
message all over the world so that

623
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:10,380
Mickey Mouse which I believe is going to

624
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:12,000
be burned in hell with the other idols.

625
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,260
That Mickey Mouse is part of global

626
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:18,150
civilization. A mouse is not

627
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:20,820
exactly something that traditionally

628
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:24,010
we've looked up to.

629
00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:28,279
It's not Mickey the lion.

630
00:30:28,279 --> 00:30:30,320
People name their children after

631
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:34,190
Lions and falcons and eagles. A

632
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:38,809
mouse isn't even an orangutan. 
633
00:30:38,809 --> 00:30:41,470
Which is quite a stunning specimen.

634
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:45,980
As far as animals go. I mean I

635
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:48,140
could look at an orangutan all day.

636
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:52,970
They're just so amazing looking. So,

637
00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:55,640
I was doing and so I looked at some

638
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:58,610
of the the cartoon, the artists that they

639
00:30:58,610 --> 00:31:00,649
have and I went to their Facebook's

640
00:31:00,649 --> 00:31:02,000
because I wanted to see what type of

641
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,549
people these were. One of them had as his

642
00:31:04,549 --> 00:31:05,450
profession,

643
00:31:05,450 --> 00:31:10,429
"Defiler of children". And it just struck

644
00:31:10,429 --> 00:31:12,649
me as so strange that somebody who was

645
00:31:12,649 --> 00:31:14,659
doing cartoons for children would

646
00:31:14,659 --> 00:31:17,149
describe themselves as a Defiler of

647
00:31:17,149 --> 00:31:20,120
children. A Defiler is a Corrupter, it's

648
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:22,039
somebody that makes something

649
00:31:22,039 --> 00:31:22,610
dirty

650
00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:26,630
that makes them unclean. So this is

651
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:28,760
a major problem that we have is that,

652
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:32,210
we're not thinking about what our young

653
00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:34,549
people are growing up with. So on the one

654
00:31:34,549 --> 00:31:37,850
hand we have the <font color="#54D130">....</font> and on the

655
00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:40,399
other hand we have the <font color="#54D130">....</font>. We

656
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:43,669
have the the dog soul which is the anger;

657
00:31:43,669 --> 00:31:46,909
so half of our ummah is filled with rage

658
00:31:46,909 --> 00:31:49,279
and a desire for vengeance. And then the

659
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:51,200
other half is is filled with <font color="#54D130">....</font>

660
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:54,640
with appetites. Concupiscent appetites.

661
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:57,860
spending too much money, going and

662
00:31:57,860 --> 00:32:00,679
wasting your money on empty things. In

663
00:32:00,679 --> 00:32:03,860
certain Muslim countries they spend 15

664
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:07,039
times more on luxury items than the

665
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:10,730
average Westerner, 15 times more a year

666
00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:12,860
on luxury items than the average

667
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:14,929
Westerner. What is that? That's a sickness.

668
00:32:14,929 --> 00:32:18,470
And that's because they're trapped in

669
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:20,720
their their lower self.

670
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:23,870
We haven't risen above these two souls

671
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:25,909
because we have, according to Imam

672
00:32:25,909 --> 00:32:28,789
Al-Ghazali we have four faculties in our

673
00:32:28,789 --> 00:32:32,000
being. Four faculties. We have the

674
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,370
irascible soul which is the dog soul, the

675
00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:34,780
<font color="#54D130">....</font>

676
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:36,880
soul which is the pig soul, and then

677
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,950
we have the Faculty of Justice which is

678
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:41,320
the balancing faculty, and then the

679
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:44,200
sage soul or the rational soul. One of

680
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,780
the American poets he said, "🎵some say the

681
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:48,880
🎵 world will end in fire. Some say in ice 🎵

682
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:52,270
🎵 From what I've tasted of desire I hold 🎵

683
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:54,580
🎵 with those who favor fire. but if it 🎵

684
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:57,130
🎵 haven't had to perish twice, I think I 🎵

685
00:32:57,130 --> 00:32:59,410
🎵 know enough of hate to say that for🎵

686
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:02,110
🎵 Destruction ice is also great and would 🎵

687
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:04,870
suffice 🎵. He's talking about these two

688
00:33:04,870 --> 00:33:07,990
forces in the world of appetite

689
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:11,740
and anger. That the world we're

690
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:13,720
going to destroy ourselves out of our

691
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,670
rage like these revolutionaries, that

692
00:33:15,670 --> 00:33:17,770
want to tear everything down, or out of

693
00:33:17,770 --> 00:33:19,780
our appetites. Where we're consuming

694
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:21,670
until there's nothing left to be

695
00:33:21,670 --> 00:33:24,130
consumed. And this is a crises because

696
00:33:24,130 --> 00:33:28,660
the sage soul, the rational soul. And

697
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:30,460
I'm talking about rational, I'm using

698
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:33,840
this not in a sense of

699
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:36,910
formal logic. I'm talking about the true

700
00:33:36,910 --> 00:33:40,120
rational soul that sees essences, that

701
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:42,550
sees first principles, that acknowledges

702
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:44,920
reality, that recognizes beauty and

703
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:47,560
harmony, that sees that behind this, is

704
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:50,560
something vast that we cannot comprehend.

705
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:52,420
We can only comprehend it in our

706
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:55,630
incomprehensible 'ti of it and this is

707
00:33:55,630 --> 00:33:59,590
our Lord this is real rationality it's

708
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:01,510
irrational to believe that this popped

709
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:03,520
into existence out of nothing the

710
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:05,800
atheists are the irrational ones not the

711
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:08,739
believers they are the truly irrational

712
00:34:08,739 --> 00:34:11,980
ones and and their crises of knowledge

713
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:13,899
should not be our crises of knowledge

714
00:34:13,899 --> 00:34:15,820
because they no longer believe in

715
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:19,480
anything their meaning is determined by

716
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:22,750
each individual this is their meaning

717
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:25,120
and this is why they can have wealth and

718
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:26,860
fame and the end yet they take their

719
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:31,270
lives even in our suffering we don't

720
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:33,250
take our lives because we believe in our

721
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:36,639
suffering that there there is there is

722
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:39,850
something spiritual about suffering

723
00:34:39,850 --> 00:34:43,530
we believe that suffering is redemptive

724
00:34:43,530 --> 00:34:47,699
this is our belief it's takfeer Avenue

725
00:34:47,699 --> 00:34:50,429
it is it is to remove our sins and there

726
00:34:50,429 --> 00:34:51,960
will be people that have great suffering

727
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:54,119
before they died and our profits of Isum

729
00:34:58,410 --> 00:35:00,690
pangs of death and actually said on his

730
00:35:00,690 --> 00:35:03,470
deathbed the pangs of death are intense

731
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:06,450
so even the best of creation was not

732
00:35:06,450 --> 00:35:09,540
spared the pangs of death because this

733
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:11,579
is the transition from this world to the

734
00:35:11,579 --> 00:35:12,510
next world

735
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:15,720
so this is important for us to keep in

736
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:23,460
mind in conclusion I would say that if

737
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:28,020
we don't seriously address the crises in

738
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:30,000
our OMA the current crises of knowledge

739
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,579
our OMA and recognize that metaphysics

740
00:35:32,579 --> 00:35:36,599
has been lost in our OMA the seeing the

741
00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:38,550
deeper causes of things that we will be

742
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:40,470
trapped in the economic causes the

743
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:43,020
political causes and fail to recognize

744
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:45,150
the deep spiritual causes that are at

745
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:47,730
the root of the human condition if we

746
00:35:47,730 --> 00:35:50,490
don't address the spiritual crises which

747
00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:53,190
is it's an intellectual crisis because

748
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:55,349
the intellect as I said is a spiritual

749
00:35:55,349 --> 00:35:58,349
organ it's it's not a material organ

750
00:35:58,349 --> 00:36:01,349
it's not a physical organ when it when

751
00:36:01,349 --> 00:36:03,480
it looks at intelligible x' it's called

752
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:06,060
bathin when it looks at spiritual

753
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:08,819
realities it's called rua or silly but

754
00:36:08,819 --> 00:36:10,470
these are all synonyms for the same

755
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:12,960
reality which is a spiritual reality if

756
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,700
we don't address this deep-seated

757
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:17,130
problem and recognize that the Faculty

758
00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:20,670
of balance has been lost that we need to

759
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:22,950
restore this balance of our triune souls

760
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:26,210
that we have intellect and we have

761
00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:29,099
emotions and we have appetites if these

762
00:36:29,099 --> 00:36:31,319
aren't working harmoniously in the

763
00:36:31,319 --> 00:36:33,720
proper order then we either perish in

764
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:37,020
fire or we perish in ice desire on the

765
00:36:37,020 --> 00:00:00,000
head of a settlement
